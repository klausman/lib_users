Lib_users
=========

Lib_users is a Python script that goes through /proc/*/maps and finds all cases
of libraries being mapped but marked as deleted. It then extracts the programs
name and arguments from /proc/<pid>/cmdline. This information is presented to
the user so that those processes can be restarted.

The reason to do this is that after an update, you might end up with processes
that run for a long time and still use old libraries. In some cases this might
be a security problem, as the library may be vulnerable. The script displays
all the distinct argument lists of processes that have deleted files mapped. In
essence, you get a list of processes and their PIDs. The reason why not just
the first elemnt of the argument list is presented is that for scripts, this
will always be the interpreter name (i.e. "perl", "python" etc.) which is not
useful by itself.

The script cleans up the list from /proc/<pid>/maps to not display false
positives - some programs have a pseudo file called /SYSxxxx mapped which
obviously is not a library that was updated.

Output formats
==============

Lib_users supports two output formats, human- and machine-readable:

human-readable:
16341 "supervising syslog-ng"
16342 "/usr/sbin/syslog-ng"
27550 "/usr/sbin/exim -bd -q15m"
12451,16244,16249,16252,16253,16254,26931,28912,29631,8810,894 "/usr/sbin/apache2 -D DEFAULT_VHOST -D INFO -D LANGUAGE -D DAV -D SVN -D MAILMAN -D PHP5 -D USERDIR -D SVN_AUTHZ -D SUEXEC -D SSL -D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST -D AUTH_DIGEST -D PERL -d /usr/lib64/apache2 -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -k start"

Here, the first column is a comma-seperated list of PIDs that share the same
command line. The second column is the command line in quotation marks. If the
-s command line option is used, there will also be information about the names
of the deleted files in use.

machine-readable:
16341;/lib64/libpcre.so.0.0.1;supervising syslog-ng
16342;/lib64/libpcre.so.0.0.1;/usr/sbin/syslog-ng
27550;/lib64/libpcre.so.0.0.1,/usr/sbin/exim;/usr/sbin/exim -bd -q15m
12451,16244,16249,16252,16253,16254,26931,28912,29631,8810,894;/lib64/libpcre.so.0.0.1;/usr/sbin/apache2 -D DEFAULT_VHOST -D INFO -D LANGUAGE -D DAV -D SVN -D MAILMAN -D PHP5 -D USERDIR -D SVN_AUTHZ -D SUEXEC -D SSL -D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST -D AUTH_DIGEST -D PERL -d /usr/lib64/apache2 -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -k start

With the -m commandline parameter changes to this form:
<list of PIDs>;<list of deleted mapped files>;<command line>

The lists are made up of comma-separated values. There are no provisions taken
for the case of one of the libraries contain a ",". The command line is also
not altered in any way. This may be fixed in a future version.

Dependencies
============

The script requires Python 2.7 or higher and should work with Python 3. It only
uses modules from Pythons standard library, so apart from a Python
installation, there are no external dependencies.

If you want to run the test suite easily, install the nose Python testing
framework. If you want to run the test suite on Python <3, you will also need
the unittest module (it is part of the Py3 stdlib). This is not needed for
day-to-day operations.

Limitations
===========

The program quite probably only works on Linux (or, at least, only on systems
that have the same maps file structure as a Linux system).

If the script is not run as root, it can not display all processes on the
system that use deleted libs. In the spirit of graceful degradation, it will
then only display the information for processes it has access to. Usually this
is the list of processes owned by the user that runs lib_users. It will also
output a warning to stderr that it could not read all map files.

False positives
===============

Some programs open temporary files and immediately delete them. This is done so
they don't leave those files behind after a crash. As a consequence, lib_users
may report these programs. A notable example are programs that use liborc, the
Oil Runtime Compiler. Here's an example, the media player quodlibet:

# lib_users 
2753 "/usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/quodlibet"
# grep deleted /proc/2753/maps 
7f409dd0b000-7f409dd1b000 rw-s 00000000 08:01 1179661 /tmp/orcexec.sqa9cE (deleted)

The file /tmp/orcexec.sqa9cE is output from the aforementioned compiler. These
processes/files can be safely ignored. In fact, restarting quodlibet will just
result in a different liborc tempfile show up as deleted.

Using the -s command line option will show you which deleted files are in use,
so you decide whether the listed process is a false positive.

Starting with lib_users 0.8, the -i and -I command line options can be used to
supply additional to-be-ignored patterns and static strings.
